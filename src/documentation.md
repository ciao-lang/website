\title Documentation

Ciao is a **Prolog** system that includes many advanced features and
extensions. As introductory material we recommend the following
resources:

 - [The Art of Prolog](https://cliplab.org/~logalg/doc/The_Art_of_Prolog.pdf) 
   (Open Access from [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/art-prolog-second-edition)).
 - [Course material in Computational Logic](http://www.cliplab.org/logalg/): Pure LP, Prolog, Efficiency, CLP, Theory, etc.
 - [Warren's Abstract Machine: A Tutorial Reconstruction](http://wambook.sourceforge.net/)
   for the foundations of Prolog implementation (recommended read
   for those interested in lower-level details of the operational
   semantics of Prolog and common optimizations performed by Prolog
   compilers).

# Reference Manuals

The following are the reference manuals for the main Ciao components:

 - [ciao](/ciao/build/doc/ciao.html/): compiler, toplevel/debugger, core libraries, extensions, etc.
 - [ciao_builder](/ciao/build/doc/ciao_builder.html/): build system.
 - [lpdoc](/ciao/build/doc/lpdoc.html/): documentation generator.
 - [ciaopp](/ciao/build/doc/ciaopp.html/): analysis, verification, (static) debugging, and optimization.
 - [ciaodbg](/ciao/build/doc/ciaodbg.html/): testing, profiling, and (dynamic) embedded debugging.
 - [ciao_playground](/ciao/build/doc/ciao_playground.html/): the Ciao playground

You can browse the available bundles and their manuals in the
**[bundle catalog](/bundles.html)**.
